# Advanced topics

There are many types of investments beyond the stock and bond portfolios discussed in other sections. These include collectibles like art, coins, and jewelry; real estate; (managed) futures; and hedge funds, which on their own have a universe of possible investments such as private equity and merger arbitrage. Most people can safely ignore derivatives and alternative asset classes. I've addressed only a few below, either because many people are tempted to invest in them for what I think are incorrect reasons, or because I think they're worth considering for experienced and informed investors. There is a detailed discussion of how to use options for long-term investing.

## Gold and other precious metals

There are a few reasons people invest in gold. They may think that it is a widely recognized store of value; that it is a reliable hedge against inflation or economic downturns; or that it will be useful as currency during a potential societal collapse because of its so-called intrinsic value.

Unfortunately, gold is not a good store of value compared to simply holding cash in a stable currency like the US dollar. It is a highly volatile asset that can lose value for long periods and has experienced no positive real return over its many centuries of use. Gold is not a reliable hedge against inflation. Its value sometimes increases when unexpected inflation occurs, and sometimes decreases. Crucially, the price does not _respond_ to inflation. For evidence and more information, you could [read](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenDilemma.pdf) [these](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenConstant.pdf) [papers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0015198X.2020.1817698) or watch [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1a3XnvRCcVo) [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0dns9fHFs&t=1347s), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHJh8CXTVQ&t=927s).

In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwctXnMnrw&t=4838s) on the Rational Reminder, Dr. Campbell Harvey discussed a fascinating interaction he had with someone who managed a family trust with an investment horizon of hundreds of years. He also mentioned the possibility that gold could lose its value in the very long run due to asteroid mining, which is a [very real prospect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XvQNt26KI) within this century.

I don't recommend investing in precious metals. If you'd like to hedge against unexpectedly high inflation, you can buy [treasury inflation-protected securities](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f4). If you want good returns during high inflation, you can invest in [Series I savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds). If you're not concerned with inflation or diversification, but instead with currency that people will value during an apocalypse, I suggest expanding your portfolio of canned food, medicine, guns, and bullets. I personally find it doubtful that anyone will accept gold coins and bars in exchange for a resource of real value at the end of the world.

In my view, aside from making specific bets on price movement, for most people there is one good reason to own gold: to protect your wealth against a collapse of the value of your home country's currency.  For US citizens, this is not a major concern: USD is the global reserve currency. For someone in a country like Venezuela or Turkey, their wealth is vulnerable to hyperinflation and the loss of their currency's value relative to other currencies. If they have access, they could simply hold other currencies or assets like US-listed securities. If not, they could own gold or a USD stablecoin, the latter of which is the only application of cryptocurrency I would consider suggesting to most people. Continue reading below.

## Cryptocurrency

[Continued from the section above.]

A USD stablecoin like [USD Coin](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc/) enables someone to own a cryptocurrency that is redeemable for USD, even if they lack access to financial institutions that would allow them to hold USD. A refugee fleeing their country with nothing but their [private key](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp) could convert USD Coin to [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) once they arrived somewhere with banking institutions (or found someone willing to exchange cash for crypto). Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Poland [actually did this](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html) during the Russian invasion in February 2022, because banking access had been obstructed and many people had to flee without the money in their bank accounts. Poland has many Bitcoin ATMs, which allowed those without _any_ banking access in Poland to convert their cryptocurrency to cash.

Stablecoins pegged to the value of a currency, most notably the US dollar but also the Euro and Japanese yen, are important because they facilitate international transactions that traditional financial institutions can make extremely difficult. A stablecoin is the only application of cryptocurrency I would currently recommend to people who aren't fascinated with the topic and are concerned with growing and protecting their wealth. However, you still need to understand [different kinds of stablecoins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iisPX_xVMV8).

[This column](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-you-can-get-crypto-investing-right-and-still-play-it-wrong-11643990277) from the WSJ describes the main issue with investing in cryptocurrencies that I'd like to express. Even if _some_ cryptocurrencies appreciate greatly in value, the distribution of returns is almost certain to be highly [positively skewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#/media/File:Relationship_between_mean_and_median_under_different_skewness.png). Unless you're determined to build a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies on your own, there is a high risk of missing out on the appreciation of a small fraction of cryptocurrencies. This is a crucial lesson in stocks as well: the [positively skewed distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek) of returns is why you need to diversify broadly to avoid the risk of underperformance. Someone holding only a few stocks or a few cryptocurrencies bears a high risk of underperforming the asset class return. On top of that, there is no guarantee that cryptocurrency will have a positive asset class return. Of course, anyone is free to bet on specific cryptocurrencies, but the advice given in this guide is deliberately not reliant on being smarter than everyone else.

## _Reducing the Risk of Black Swans_

Finding imperfectly correlated assets is the heart of [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#clarifying-diversification). A portfolio with uncorrelated assets that each have high expected return would be ideal. But how could we achieve equity-like returns that aren't highly correlated with equities? _[Reducing the Risk of Black Swans](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Reducing+the+Risk+of+Black+Swans&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def)_, by Larry Swedroe and Kevin Grogan, seeks to answer this question. You can click the link to download the book. I won't elaborate because these asset classes are accessible only to high net worth investors and clients of certain wealth management firms. They are also partially illiquid, which is why access is restricted. Regardless of whether you have access, it's a great read because it explores why diversification is important and how to build a truly diversified portfolio with high expected return.

## Real estate investment trusts (REITs)

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IzK5x3LlsUU) by Ben Felix on REITs.

The best argument for holding REITs is that they are very tax-inefficient. This must be priced in, so overweighting them in a tax-advantaged account could be expected to lead to higher returns, because you would be utterly indifferent to taxable distributions. This is argued [here](https://mymoneywizard.com/reits-in-roth-ira-loophole/). I recommend against overweighting REITs in a taxable account.

Both Avantis and DFA have real estate ETFs: [AVRE](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-real-estate-etf.html) (global) and [DFAR](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfar/us-real-estate-etf) (US). Like any ETFs from these managers, they are fairly new, but DFA's mutual fund counterpart [DFREX](https://us.dimensional.com/funds/real-estate-securities) was launched in 1993. Its past performance compared to Vanguard's fund is [here](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2022&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=VGSIX&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=DFREX&allocation2_2=100).

&nbsp;

The long-term, high-risk portfolio suggested in the [fund section](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#example-portfolio) was:

40% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) + 21% [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 14% [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 11% [AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 7% [AVIV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 7% [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html)

We also [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#beyond-mainstream-factor-funds) Alpha Architect products in that section. They hold more concentrated portfolios of 50 equal-weighted stocks, but they offer a way to diversify implementation of value investing. So for a tax-advantaged account, here are possible portfolios with Alpha Architect value funds and a real estate fund:

20% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) + 18% [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 12% [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 11% [AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 7% [AVIV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 7% [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html) + 11% [QVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/qval/) + 7% [IVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/ival/) + 7% [AVRE](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-real-estate-etf.html)

or

20% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) + 18% [DFSV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfsv/us-small-cap-value-etf) + 12% [DFUV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfuv/us-marketwide-value-etf) + 11% [DISV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf) + 7% [DFIV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfiv/international-value-etf) + 7% [DFEV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfev/emerging-markets-value-etf) + 11% [QVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/qval/) + 7% [IVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/ival/) + 7% [DFAR](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfar/us-real-estate-etf)

&nbsp;

In a taxable account, REIT funds should be eliminated:

20% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) + 19% [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 13% [AVLV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-us-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 12% [AVDV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-small-cap-value-etf.html) + 8% [AVIV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-international-large-cap-value-etf.html) + 8% [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html) + 12% [QVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/qval/) + 8% [IVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/ival/)

or

20% [VT](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vt) + 19% [DFSV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfsv/us-small-cap-value-etf) + 13% [DFUV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfuv/us-marketwide-value-etf) + 12% [DISV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/disv/international-small-cap-value-etf) + 8% [DFIV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfiv/international-value-etf) + 8% [DFEV](https://us.dimensional.com/etfs/dfev/emerging-markets-value-etf) + 12% [QVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/qval/) + 8% [IVAL](https://etfsite.alphaarchitect.com/ival/)

&nbsp;

I'll emphasize that overweighting REITs is a debatable decision. Both of these portfolios have an acute value tilt and their returns will sometimes deviate greatly from the market (VT). Someone with a large account could invest in Avantis and DFA funds instead of picking only one of them. They could split the allocation to AVUV or DFSV between the two, and do the same with AVLV/DFUV, AVDV/DISV, AVIV/DFIV, and AVES/DFEV. Note that AVRE and DFAR are not as similar as the other pairs, because AVRE is a global fund and DFAR is a US fund. However, more than two-thirds of AVRE's portfolio is in the US.

&nbsp;

## Leveraged funds

In 2006, the SEC [finally permitted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-moves-to-curb-leveraged-etfs-1465205401) the creation of highly leveraged funds, and asset managers like Direxion and ProShares have since launched well over 100 leveraged ETFs. Some of them were listed in the midst of the stock market's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. This turned out to be impeccable timing, because the 2010s witnessed a spectacular bull market for US stocks, in particular tech stocks. Additionally, interest rates have been low since 2009, minimizing the cost of using derivatives to lever up the returns. The leveraged fund with the largest AUM is [TQQQ](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/tqqq/). It's named after QQQ, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. The fund uses derivatives to produce three times the daily returns of the Nasdaq 100. If QQQ increases 1% tomorrow, TQQQ will increase by about 3%. If QQQ falls by 2%, TQQQ will fall by about 6%.<sup id="fn1">[[1]](#f1)</sup>

From inception in February 2010 through the end of 2021, the average annualized return of TQQQ was [roughly 55%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=TQQQ&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_2=100). An investor who bought shares at the end of Feb 2010 and sold at the end of Dec 2021 would've multiplied their money by about 179.<sup id="fn2">[[2]](#f2)</sup> These are eye-watering, brain-shattering, hair-on-fire returns. Who wouldn't want to invest in TQQQ?

We don't have to move into wild hypotheticals to see how a triple-leveraged fund can be hazardous. It's notable that TQQQ was fortunate enough to incept in 2010, meaning that so far it has never experienced a major, prolonged drawdown for US stocks. (TQQQ fell by 69.9% during the COVID crash, but the market quickly recovered.) However, QQQ was created in March 1999. What if we simply back up the clock and infer the returns of TQQQ from QQQ? What would have happened during the implosion of the tech bubble in the early 2000s?<sup id="fn3">[[3]](#f3)</sup>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/TQQQ.png" width="631" height="540"/>
</p>

From inception to its lowest point in 2002, QQQ fell by 60.7%. TQQQ would have experienced a decline of about 99.5% in the same period. From its peak, QQQ drew down by 83.0%, while TQQQ would have fallen by about 99.94%. TQQQ investors would have lost virtually everything, and the fund arguably would have closed down. Had TQQQ been launched alongside QQQ and stayed open, the return since inception of QQQ would be superior to that of TQQQ.

An investor seeking high expected return _could_ allocate a __fraction__ of their portfolio to a leveraged ETF, and rebalance when its weight deviates significantly from its intended weight. But as I'll explain in the next section, I think options offer a preferable form of leverage. [Click here](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced#etf-call-options-or-leveraged-etfs) for a direct comparison and more (very important!) information on leveraged ETFs.

## Options

Options are a [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp), which means they derive their value from the price of an underlying security, like a stock or an ETF. They are complex — much harder to understand than a stock or bond fund. So I don't expect a reader to feel like they have a complete understanding of how to invest in options after reading the section below. Before or after reading the written information, it will help to watch videos. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PM4rNDr4oI) is a detailed tutorial on how options work. Combining this with the written suggestions below will help with digesting this dense material. The YouTube channel [InTheMoney](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMiRVQJuTj3NpZZP1tKShQ/videos) is a good resource on options in general, and his outro music is hypnotic. Understanding options is not easy and will require multiple hours of effort to reach a point at which you can think about how to include them in your portfolio.

### Introduction to options

Before explaining what options are, I think it will be useful to describe why we would consider using them. In the section on risk, we [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#two-broad-types-of-risk) the distinction between compensated and uncompensated risk. And in the section on building a stock portfolio, we [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#moving-beyond-market-cap-weighting) how to systematically invest in riskier stocks in order to increase our expected return. This is a way of taking compensated risk, which is the kind of risk we want. But how could we take even more compensated risk than owning stock funds — which are already quite volatile — with the hope of greater long-term returns? Buying stock is a bet that the stock portfolio will have positive returns, and buying options is a way to make a more extreme bet that those shares will have positive returns. This is a form of [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): a correct prediction can yield much greater gains, and an incorrect one can cause large losses.

So what is an option? It’s a contract between you and another person, who is called the "counterparty" because they’re taking the other side of the trade. The value of the contract is based partly on the value of an underlying security, like an ETF. There are different types of options, but we’ll focus on only one type, a call option. We’ll make up an ETF with the ticker “XY”. If we buy a call option on XY, the contract would provide us with certain rights.

For each call option contract we buy, we acquire the right to buy 100 shares of XY from the counterparty at an agreed-upon price anytime before an agreed-upon expiration date. The option has a cost, called the premium, because we pay the counterparty for these valuable rights. The agreed-upon price at which we can buy XY is an important aspect of the option, because being able to buy shares at a lower price makes the option more valuable. The agreed-upon price is called the "strike price". The expiration date is another important aspect, because a more distant expiration date gives XY more time to increase in value. At any time, the owner of a call option can exercise it and buy 100 shares per contract from the counterparty at the strike price. They can also sell the option to someone else anytime during market hours. In this example, XY is the "[underlying](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying.asp)" because the value of an XY option is influenced by the price of XY. An option always controls exactly 100 shares of the underlying.

&nbsp;

### An option’s value

How is the value of an option determined? Like any other security, the market decides on the prevailing price through negotiation between buyers and sellers. But as always, the characteristics of the security act as constraints. An option’s value is divided between intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is simple: if an option’s strike price is below the current market price, the option has intrinsic value. Let’s say the option’s strike price is $150 and the market price is $200. That means we can exercise the option, buy the shares at $150 and sell them at $200. The $50 profit would be multiplied by 100 shares per contract. That’s the nature of intrinsic value.

But even an option whose strike price is greater than the market price has value. We call it extrinsic value, because it reflects the potential for an option to acquire intrinsic value (or gain more than it already has) before expiration. If the strike price were $150 and the market price were $140, there would be no value in exercising the option presently. But it has extrinsic value because the market price may rise above $150 before expiration. An option with a strike price less than the market price is “in the money” (ITM); an option with a strike price greater than the market price is “out of the money” (OTM); and an option with a strike price close to the market price is “at the money” (ATM). As silly as it sounds, this variable is called "moneyness". An in-the-money option has intrinsic value because it could be exercised profitably _right now_, while an out-of-the-money option does not. The value of an OTM option is entirely composed of extrinsic value (also known as time value). An ITM option has both intrinsic and extrinsic value.

&nbsp;

### Example

Let’s make this more concrete. It’s November 2023, and we own shares of XY, but we’d also like to gain leverage on our expectation that XY’s share price will rise. So we buy call options on XY that expire on January 20, 2025. Let’s say the current share price of XY is $50. For reasons I’ll explain below, we want to buy an in-the-money (ITM) option. So we check the price of XY call options expiring on January 20, 2025 with a strike price of $45. The [ask price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) of the option's premium is $7.41, which refers to the cost per share. To calculate the cost per contract, we multiply by 100 to find that the cost of buying a contract is $741.

How much could we profit or lose from this option? Let’s say that by the expiration date, XY’s price has increased by 10% to $55. Our strike price is $45, so we exercise on the expiration date and buy 100 shares for $45. We sell them immediately for $55, making $10 per share and a total of $1,000. Our profit is $259: $1,000 minus the $741 premium. We can compare this to buying shares with the same amount of money: $741 of shares would’ve increased in value by 10% or $74.10.

Note that we’re referring to XY’s _price_ and not its total return. An owner of the underlying receives dividends, whereas an owner of a call option does not. So if XY’s price increased by 10%, an investor in XY shares would’ve gained slightly more. Keep the lack of dividends in mind when considering possible returns of a call option.

Let’s consider the potential downside of an option. Imagine that XY’s share price has fallen 16% to $42 by the expiration date. Because $42 is less than the strike price of $45, the option expires worthless. The loss would be the value of the contract we purchased: $741. Buying shares with the same $741 would have produced a loss of only $118.56 (minus reinvested dividends).

There are more ways to lose money with options than a total loss due to OTM expiration. Imagine that by expiration, XY has appreciated by only 2% to $51. We exercise the option, buying shares at $45 and selling at $51, netting $6 per share and a total of $600. But wait, we _paid_ $741 for this option! So we actually lost $141. Not only that, but if we had bought $741 of shares instead, we would’ve made $14.82 from price appreciation and some more from dividends. The $141 + $14.82 + dividends is an [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost): we would've profited by purchasing shares instead of an option.

The last situation is good for the counterparty. They’re likely holding 100 shares of XY for every contract they sell you. So they benefit from the dividends and the $741 premium you paid for the contract. They sell those 100 shares to you at a discounted price when you exercise, but your ability to buy shares at $45 and make $600 is more than compensated by the $741 premium they received over a year prior. It would be very risky for the counterparty to not hold 100 shares per contract they sell, because they would otherwise be exposed to unlimited losses. Selling a call while you hold the underlying is known as selling a covered call.<sup id="fn4">[[4]](#f4)</sup>

Let's dissect how the option is valued in this last example. The premium was $741 and, when we purchased it, the option had $500 of intrinsic value: $50 - $45 = $5 per share, and we multiply by 100 shares. This implies that it had $741 - $500 = $241 of extrinsic value. The option _gained_ intrinsic value by expiration: $51 - $45 = $6 per share, giving it an intrinsic value of $600. But because it was the day of expiration, the option had no extrinsic value remaining. Even though intrinsic value increased while we held the option, we lost money because extrinsic value decreased by a greater amount. We can imagine an alternative example where XY reached a price of $51 three months before expiration. At that time, we could decide to sell the option for more than $600. We know the option's extrinsic value would be greater than zero, because it reflects the potential for more growth in the three months before expiration.

### Calculating the breakeven price

An important price you should be able to calculate before buying an option is the breakeven price. This is the price the underlying needs to reach by expiration for you to break even. We paid $7.41 per share for the option with a strike price of $45 when XY's price was $50. In order to break even, the act of exercising needs to generate the same value as the premium we paid, which was $741. So the price would need to rise to $45 + $7.41 = $52.41, which is a 4.82% increase from $50. Of course, if the option expires at the breakeven price or slightly above, we would've profited more by investing in shares instead, so this doesn't consider the opportunity cost. Remember that in the last example above, we lost money because XY had increased to a price of only $51, which is less than the breakeven price of $52.41.

The breakeven price is important not just for understanding a given option, but for comparing different options. If we buy an ITM option with a strike price of $45 while the market price is $50, that option is 10% ITM: (50-45)/50 = .1 = 10%. If we were to buy a 20% ITM option with a strike price of $40, the breakeven price would be significantly lower. The option would also carry a lower risk of expiring worthless. However, the premium would be more expensive. In contrast, an at-the-money (ATM) option with a strike price of $50 would have a higher breakeven price than an ITM option. An OTM option with a strike price of $55 would be even cheaper, but it would have a breakeven price that is higher still. The 10% OTM option might have a premium of only $220. But that would make the breakeven price $55 + $2.20 = $57.20, which is a 14.4% increase from $50. So anyone who buys an OTM contract is betting on high returns for the underlying. Options that are deeper in the money are less risky and have higher premiums; options that are further out of the money are riskier and have lower premiums.

For most investors who want to lever up by buying call options, I think it's sensible to buy long-dated options with breakeven prices that anticipate modest returns, like the 10% ITM option with a breakeven increase of 4.82% and expiration in 14 months. Buying OTM options is risky and can easily lead to major losses, including total loss.

&nbsp;

### Risk management

Risk management with this approach to options is relatively simple. The first aspect is appropriate position sizing. Even for someone with a high risk tolerance and a 30-year time horizon, I don't recommend occupying more than 15% of your portfolio with options. In a portfolio with 90% stock funds and 10% ETF call options, the options will generate at least as much volatility as the stock funds despite being a much smaller portion. Exceeding 20% of your portfolio would be very risky, unless you're buying deep ITM options (as Nancy Pelosi [often does](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/nancy-pelosi-husband-buys-millions-4-mega-cap-tech-stocks-2021-7)).

In addition to position sizing, rebalancing is crucial. If the underlying securities perform very well in a given year, your options are likely to expand to a larger part of the portfolio. This expansion could keep occurring for years in a long bull market, but you should not allow it. There is no way to reliably predict it, but eventually the underlying ETFs will experience a deep, prolonged drawdown. Their prices will fall below the strike prices of your options, and the options will expire worthless. This is why, regardless of risk tolerance, no one should ever invest 100% of their portfolio in options (or highly leveraged ETFs, as we saw with TQQQ and the tech bubble).

Disciplined rebalancing needs to occur when options thrive and when they die. In a spectacular year when your options expand from 10% to 25% of your portfolio, it's important to restrain yourself. When you sell the options, do not invest all that money into more options. Reinvest 10% of the value of your portfolio in options, and the rest into your stock funds (assuming 10% is your intended allocation). Otherwise, the allocation to options could keep expanding until one year, your options finally expire worthless and blow up a third of your portfolio, erasing all the leveraged gains.

On the other hand, when your options expire worthless during a bear market, it's important not to let the disappointment and regret deter you from persisting. If all your options expired worthless, rebalance them from 0% back to 10% (again, assuming 10% is the intended weight). If you rebalance correctly year after year, the options will occasionally go to zero, but your portfolio will be much larger in the long run. The stock funds are a way to secure your leveraged gains when they succeed, and they serve as fuel for more gains when your options evaporate.

Most people do not have the risk tolerance or the cold discipline for this approach. A leveraged portfolio will add undue stress to your life if you're unable to detach yourself from the daily volatility and __focus on the soundness of the process__. Carefully consider whether you have the right disposition.

&nbsp;

### Which ETFs?

Many ETFs have option markets (mutual funds do not). Ideally, I could invest in my [favorite portfolio of ETFs](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#example-portfolio) and buy call options on the same ETFs. But options are not like ETFs, where bid-ask spreads are negligible for long-term investors. Bid-ask spreads on an ETF that isn't especially popular might be 0.1% or 0.2%, but this is insignificant because it's still a small spread and you can hold for a long time. Liquidity becomes a very important consideration for options because you can't hold for an indefinite duration and, more importantly, spreads on ETFs with very little options activity can be abysmal. It's not hard to find an ETF that has some options with 50% bid-ask spreads. Options with the same underlying can differ greatly in liquidity, because options that are currently being traded less frequently have larger spreads. These tend to be options with more distant expiration dates and strike prices that are further from the market price (deep ITM or OTM).

So we can't simply pick our favorite ETFs. [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) has a thinly traded option market with wide spreads, and [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html) is so new that there is no option trading. We have to narrow our focus to ETFs with large AUM and high trading volume, which tend to be provided by large asset managers like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Invesco. Not only do ETFs with more active option markets have smaller spreads, they also have a larger number of available expiration dates.

Let's start with exposure to cap-weighted equity. The most liquid option market in the world is [SPY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy), an S&P 500 ETF managed by State Street. This is a good enough representation of cap-weighted US equity to use for call options. The main drawback is not that SPY includes only 500 stocks, but that SPY has a share price over $400. Long-dated call options on an ETF with such a high share price are several thousand dollars for a single contract, which is an obstacle for small investors. [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti), Vanguard's total US stock ETF, has a lower share price and a very liquid option market. For developed markets outside the US, [EFA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239623/ishares-msci-eafe-etf) has by far the most liquid options. It does not include Canada, but Canada occupies only 3% of global market capitalization.

For emerging markets, [EEM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239637/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-etf) has the most actively traded options. However, it has an expense ratio of 0.68%, so [VWO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwo), Vanguard's emerging markets ETF with an expense ratio of 0.08%, may be a good substitute. EEM has a larger selection of expiration dates, but if there is a VWO option with a similar bid-ask spread and an expiration date suitable for your portfolio, it is probably a better fund. The same applies to [IEMG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244050/ishares-core-msci-emerging-markets-etf), although its expiration dates are even more limited than those of VWO. VWO does not include South Korea but EEM and IEMG do, so an options portfolio with EFA and VWO will omit South Korea. For a much lower expense ratio, this is arguably an acceptable drawback. [IWN](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239712/ishares-russell-2000-value-etf) has the most liquid options for US small cap value.

So we can build a globally diversified portfolio with [SPY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy) or [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) for US equity; [EFA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239623/ishares-msci-eafe-etf) for developed ex-North America equity; [EEM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239637/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-etf), [VWO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwo) or [IEMG](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/244050/ishares-core-msci-emerging-markets-etf) for emerging markets equity; and [IWN](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239712/ishares-russell-2000-value-etf) for US small cap value stocks.

### Practical information

The explanation above described options as if the goal were to exercise them. An option is indeed valuable because of the owner's right to exercise it, but most people who buy an option don't exercise it — they sell it. Practically, you probably will not have enough money in your account to exercise a call option without liquidating other assets. In the example above with XY, we bought a call option with a strike price of $45, which means that buying 100 shares would require $4,500. Rather than coming up with that much money, it usually makes more sense to sell the option before expiration (in this case, before market close on Jan 20 2025).

You don't have to wait until the day of expiration to sell an option. As I mentioned above, options with closer expiration dates tend to be more liquid, so waiting until expiration is within a week will probably grant you the smallest bid-ask spread. You could also roll the expiration dates much sooner. For example, we bought the XY option in November 2023, 14 months before expiration. We could sell it three months before expiration in October 2024 and roll to an XY call option expiring on Jan 20 2026. Neither is inherently better, but rolling before the final month avoids the comparatively rapid decay of extrinsic value that tends to occur as expiration approaches.

When trading options, the possible actions are not just "buy" and "sell". They are "buy to open", "buy to close", "sell to open", and "sell to close". The strategy discussed above is called a "long call", and for that you need only two actions: "buy to open" when you buy the option and open the position, then "sell to close" when you sell the option. "Exercise" is a fifth possible action and will close a long call position but, as mentioned, it's rare that this is appropriate. Some brokers make it hard to exercise because they don't want people to unwittingly squander the extrinsic value of the option. If you plan to exercise, ensure that you find out in advance exactly how to exercise an option with your broker.

Like applying for margin, you have to apply for option trading. Brokers distinguish between different types of option trades, based on how potentially risky the types of trades are. Long calls are a relatively low-risk strategy. Fidelity separates option trading into Levels 1 through 5, and to run this strategy you need Level 2. Schwab has Levels 0 through 3, and to run this strategy you need Level 1.

While most brokers have eliminated commissions for stocks and ETFs, each purchase or sale of an option has a commission of $0.65 per contract. This is negligible compared to the price of any long-dated option.

More incoming: automatic exercise after end of day on expiration date; automatic selling if not enough cash in account; when to exercise an option; rolling an option by selling and buying simultaneously.

### ETF call options or leveraged ETFs?

This section is disorganized for now. More incoming.

We discussed above how we could build a portfolio of ETF call options, perhaps VTI + EFA + VWO + IWN. Could we build a similar portfolio with leveraged ETFs? We could achieve 2x daily exposure to the S&P 500 ([SSO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/sso/)/[SPUU](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-sp-500-bull-2x-etf)), developed ex-North America markets ([EFO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/efo/)), and emerging markets ([EET](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/eet/)). We could also achieve 3x daily exposure to the S&P 500 ([UPRO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/upro/)/[SPXL](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-sp-500-bull-bear-3x-etfs)) and emerging markets ([EDC](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-msci-emerging-markets-bull-bear-3x-etfs)), but not developed ex-US markets since Direxion liquidated [DZK](https://etfdb.com/etf/DZK) in 2020. There are no LETFs with small cap value exposure. Since small cap value adds a great deal of diversification to a cap-weighted portfolio, this is a significant drawback. But let's focus on the question only for cap-weighted equities: are call options or LETFs a better way to increase compensated risk?

Investors in LETFs need to understand that these funds are not magical machines that automatically multiply the daily returns of an index. The leverage depends on derivatives like total return swaps that are facilitated by banks who partner with the ETF issuers. The banks that administer total return swaps can set the terms of the arrangement, including margin requirements. LETFs are most likely to be shut down due to financial stress at exactly the wrong time, when the market is dropping and leveraged funds are suffering apocalyptic drawdowns. This would leave investors with whatever fraction of their money is left, without the ability to potentially make up their losses with the same leveraged fund. So following [this advice](https://seekingalpha.com/article/4464730-pricing-of-leveraged-etf-decay-a-different-approach) is a good idea: "avoid, at all costs, issuers with poor ratings and small market caps not backed by substantial parents with deep pockets."

The quoted warning is crucial to understand. First, an LETF’s issuer should have the ability to meet increased margin requirements (i.e., fork over cash) during market crashes. Given the current offerings, I would be reluctant to invest in highly leveraged ETFs sponsored by anyone other than ProShares or Direxion. Second, the fund should have large AUM. During the 2020 COVID crash, a number of LETFs [were liquidated](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/etf-closures-outnumber-launches-2020-04-20), including funds managed by ProShares and Direxion. They were unwilling to save some of their smaller funds that were insufficiently profitable (or perhaps not profitable at all). And the COVID crash was not nearly the worst case scenario for LETFs: it was brief and witnessed only a 35% drawdown for US stocks. Due to the recent inception of LETFs, they have yet to endure a long bear market where the stock market is cut in half, like those in 1973-74, 2000-02, and 2007-09. How many LETFs will be shut down during the next crisis?

With these criteria, the only LETFs whose durability I am fairly confident in are those with billions of AUM. Among the list of seven funds above, the only funds that qualify are S&P 500 2x and 3x funds: [SSO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/sso/), [UPRO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/upro/), and [SPXL](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-sp-500-bull-bear-3x-etfs). During bear markets, nervous investors pull their money out of equity funds. So LETFs with even greater losses than the market will undoubtedly lose investors during a crash, but these three funds have AUM to spare.

If you accept what I've stated so far, this implies that building a diversified equity portfolio with LETFs is not possible (without accepting the liquidation risk of less mainstream funds). Options do not carry any similar risk: counterparty risk is borne by the [Options Clearing Corporation](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/occ.asp), so your option contract is sound regardless of economic distress.

LETFs have a lower minimum cost of entry: the share price. Long-dated call options are expensive, and there is no way to buy less expensive contracts that control fewer than 100 shares.

With options, it is easy to customize the risk you want to accept by selecting from many strike prices. A 40% ITM option provides moderate leverage and somewhat heightened risk. A 10% OTM option is very risky and provides a great deal of leverage. With LETFs, the choice is between 2x and 3x daily leverage (or in the case of developed ex-US markets, only 2x).

The returns of an LETF are path-dependent, while the intrinsic value of an option is not. That is, different degrees of volatility for the index an LETF is leveraging lead to different returns. For a given return of an index, higher volatility of the index produces lower LETF returns. Thus, the 2020 COVID crash was minimally damaging to LETFs, because the market fell and recovered in a relatively straight line.

You could combine the two approaches and buy call options on LETFs. But let's not get crazy.

Discuss [Hedgefundie portfolio](https://www.optimizedportfolio.com/hedgefundie-adventure/): roughly 50% [UPRO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/upro/) + roughly 50% [TMF](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-20-year-treasury-bull-bear-3x-etfs).

Footnotes:

<sup id="f1"> 1 </sup> Beyond one day, the multiplier does not apply. Let's say QQQ increased by 2% on day 1 and 1.5% on day 2. TQQQ would increase by 6%, then by 4.5%. The cumulative increase for QQQ would be 1.02 × 1.015 = 1.0353, or 3.53%. We can't simply multiply by three: for TQQQ it would be 1.06 × 1.045 = 1.1077, or 10.77%.

We can do another calculation to exhibit how mere volatility reduces the returns of leveraged funds. Let's say QQQ increased by 3% on day 1 and fell back to its previous level on day 2. QQQ's cumulative return would be: 1.03 × (1/1.03) = 1. TQQQ's cumulative return would be: 1.09 × (.94/1.03) = .9948 (explained below). So while QQQ's return after two days is flat, TQQQ's return is -.52%. This is just an example which shows that the movements of a leveraged fund need not be directionally the same as that of its underlying index, even after only two days.

To calculate the return of a triple-leveraged fund on a single day given its index's return (R), compute 3×(R-1)+1. Take the 2% increase of QQQ in the first example, so R = 1.02. 3×(1.02-1)+1 simplifies to 1.06 or 6%. That's pretty simple. Now take day 2 of the second example, where QQQ returns to its original level after rising 3% the prior day. We know the multiplier for QQQ must be 1/1.03 on day 2. So we insert that as R: 3×((1/1.03)-1)+1 simplifies to (.94/1.03), which is why I used that expression in the paragraph above. [↩](#fn1)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f2"> 2 </sup> Had an investor done the same, but sold only slightly later on May 11 2022, the value would've fallen by 65.4%, making the total multiplier 62 instead of 179. This is still incredible, but it illustrates the extreme volatility of this fund. [↩](#fn2)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f3"> 3 </sup> The calculations were done assuming that TQQQ's expense ratio would have been 75 basis points higher than QQQ's expense ratio, as it is today. This is an underestimate, since interest rates were higher in 1999-2002. [↩](#fn3)

&nbsp;

<sup id="f4"> 4 </sup> Let's consider what the counterparty wants when they sell (AKA write) a covered call. An important feature of selling a covered call is that once the price is equal to or exceeds the strike price, the option writer is not affected by further increases in price. If the price increased to $60 by expiration, their profit would be dividends plus $241 ($741 premium + $1000 from holding 100 shares - $1500 from selling shares at the strike price). If the price fell to $45 by expiration, their profit would be dividends plus $241 ($741 premium - $500 from holding 100 shares). In this case they don't have to sell shares to the option holder because the option expired exactly ATM with no value. However, if the price fell below the strike price of $45, the option writer's profit would diminish below dividends plus $241 and would eventually become negative.

What's the significance of the breakeven price for the option writer? Assuming they hold 100 shares, the breakeven price of $52.41 is the point above which they would've profited _more_ by not selling the call. They may not directly lose money if the price jumps to $60, but they'll wish they hadn't surrendered the upside to the option holder by selling the call. Due to the bid-ask spread, the exact breakeven price for the option holder is not a significant price for the option writer. When the option holder paid a $7.41 premium per share, the option writer might have received $7.10 per share. Any price at expiration above $45 + $7.10 = $52.10 would make the option writer wish they hadn't sold the call. Prices below $45 would make the covered call less profitable or unprofitable. Any difference in price at expiration between $45 and $52.10 is irrelevant to the option writer, whose profit will be $241 plus dividends in this range.

A call option writer is not forced to sell their 100 shares to the option holder. Like the option holder, they can exit the contract. An option holder enters the contract by selecting "buy to open" and exits by selecting "sell to close". An option writer enters by selecting "sell to open" and exits by selecting "buy to close". The writer would have to pay the contemporaneous option premium in order to buy out of the contract.

According to [IRS publication 550](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550), dividends received by someone who is "grantor (writer) of an option to buy substantially identical stock or securities" cannot be [qualified dividends](https://github.com/investindex/Taxes#the-essentials). So if the option writer were selling the covered call in a taxable account, they would unfortunately pay ordinary income tax rates on XY's dividends, purely because they sold a covered call.
