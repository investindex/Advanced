# Advanced topics

There are many types of investments beyond the stock and bond portfolios discussed in other sections. These include collectibles like art and coins, real estate, futures, and hedge funds, which on their own have a universe of possible investments such as private equity and merger arbitrage. Most people can safely ignore all of them. I've addressed only a few below, either because many people are tempted to invest in them for what I think are incorrect reasons, or because I think they're worth considering for experienced and informed investors.

## Gold and other precious metals

There are a few reasons people invest in gold. They may think that it is a reliable, widely recognized store of value; that it is a reliable hedge against inflation or economic downturns; or that it will be useful as currency during a potential societal collapse because of its so-called intrinsic value.

Unfortunately, gold is not a good store of value compared to stable currencies like the US dollar. It is a highly volatile asset that can lose value for long periods and has experienced no positive real return over its many centuries of use. Gold is not a reliable hedge against inflation. Its value sometimes increases when unexpected inflation occurs, and sometimes decreases. Crucially, the price does not _respond_ to inflation. For evidence and more information, you could read [this paper](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenDilemma.pdf) or watch videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0dns9fHFs&t=1347s), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHJh8CXTVQ&t=927s).

In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwctXnMnrw&t=4838s) on the Rational Reminder, Dr. Campbell Harvey discussed a fascinating interaction he had with someone who managed a family trust with an investment horizon of hundreds of years. He also mentioned the possibility that gold could lose its value in the very long run due to asteroid mining, which is [not wild speculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XvQNt26KI).

I don't recommend investing in precious metals. If you'd like to hedge against unexpectedly high inflation, you can buy [treasury inflation-protected securities](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f4). If you want good returns during high inflation, you can invest in [Series I savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds). If you're not concerned with inflation or diversification, but instead with currency that people will value during an apocalypse, I suggest expanding your portfolio of canned food, medicine, guns, and bullets. I personally find it doubtful that anyone will accept gold coins and bars in exchange for something of real value at the end of the world.

In my view, for most people there is one good reason to own gold: to protect your wealth against a collapse of the value of your home country's currency.  For US citizens, this is not a major concern: USD is the global reserve currency. For someone in a country like Venezuela or Turkey, their wealth is vulnerable to hyperinflation and the loss of their currency's value relative to other currencies. If they have access, they could simply hold other currencies or assets like US-listed securities. If not, they could own gold or a USD stablecoin, the latter of which is the only application of cryptocurrency I would consider suggesting to most people. A USD stablecoin like [USD Coin](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc/) enables someone to own a cryptocurrency that is redeemable for USD, even if they lack access to banking institutions that would allow them to hold USD. A refugee fleeing their country with nothing but their [private key](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp) could convert USD coin to fiat currency once they arrived somewhere with banking institutions (or someone willing to exchange cash for crypto). Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Poland [actually did this](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html) during the Russian invasion in February 2022, because banking access had been obstructed and many people had to flee without the money in their bank accounts.
