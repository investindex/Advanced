## Gold and other precious metals

Gold is a volatile asset that can lose value for many consecutive years and has experienced no positive real return over time. It is not a reliable hedge against inflation. For more information, you could read [this paper](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenDilemma.pdf) or watch videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0dns9fHFs&t=1347s), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHJh8CXTVQ&t=927s).

In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwctXnMnrw&t=4838s) on the Rational Reminder, Dr. Campbell Harvey discussed a fascinating interaction he had with someone who managed a family trust with an investment horizon of hundreds of years. He also mentioned the possibility that gold could lose its value in the very long run due to asteroid mining, which is [not wild speculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XvQNt26KI).

I don't recommend investing in precious metals. If you're not concerned with inflation or diversification, but instead with currency that people will value during an apocalypse, I suggest expanding your portfolio of canned food, antibiotics, guns, and bullets. I personally find it doubtful that anyone will accept gold coins and bars in exchange for something of real value at the end of the world.
