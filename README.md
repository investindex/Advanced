# Advanced topics

There are many types of investments beyond the stock and bond portfolios discussed in other sections. These include collectibles like art, coins, and jewelry; real estate; (managed) futures; and hedge funds, which on their own have a universe of possible investments such as private equity and merger arbitrage. Most people can safely ignore derivatives and alternative asset classes. I've addressed only a few below, either because many people are tempted to invest in them for what I think are incorrect reasons, or because I think they're worth considering for experienced and informed investors.

## Gold and other precious metals

There are a few reasons people invest in gold. They may think that it is a widely recognized store of value; that it is a reliable hedge against inflation or economic downturns; or that it will be useful as currency during a potential societal collapse because of its so-called intrinsic value.

Unfortunately, gold is not a good store of value compared to stable currencies like the US dollar. It is a highly volatile asset that can lose value for long periods and has experienced no positive real return over its many centuries of use. Gold is not a reliable hedge against inflation. Its value sometimes increases when unexpected inflation occurs, and sometimes decreases. Crucially, the price does not _respond_ to inflation. For evidence and more information, you could [read](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenDilemma.pdf) [these](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenConstant.pdf) [papers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0015198X.2020.1817698) or watch videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0dns9fHFs&t=1347s), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHJh8CXTVQ&t=927s).

In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwctXnMnrw&t=4838s) on the Rational Reminder, Dr. Campbell Harvey discussed a fascinating interaction he had with someone who managed a family trust with an investment horizon of hundreds of years. He also mentioned the possibility that gold could lose its value in the very long run due to asteroid mining, which is [not wild speculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XvQNt26KI).

I don't recommend investing in precious metals. If you'd like to hedge against unexpectedly high inflation, you can buy [treasury inflation-protected securities](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f4). If you want good returns during high inflation, you can invest in [Series I savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds). If you're not concerned with inflation or diversification, but instead with currency that people will value during an apocalypse, I suggest expanding your portfolio of canned food, medicine, guns, and bullets. I personally find it doubtful that anyone will accept gold coins and bars in exchange for something of real value at the end of the world.

In my view, for most people there is one good reason to own gold: to protect your wealth against a collapse of the value of your home country's currency.  For US citizens, this is not a major concern: USD is the global reserve currency. For someone in a country like Venezuela or Turkey, their wealth is vulnerable to hyperinflation and the loss of their currency's value relative to other currencies. If they have access, they could simply hold other currencies or assets like US-listed securities. If not, they could own gold or a USD stablecoin, the latter of which is the only application of cryptocurrency I would consider suggesting to most people. A USD stablecoin like [USD Coin](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc/) enables someone to own a cryptocurrency that is redeemable for USD, even if they lack access to financial institutions that would allow them to hold USD. A refugee fleeing their country with nothing but their [private key](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp) could convert USD Coin to [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) once they arrived somewhere with banking institutions (or found someone willing to exchange cash for crypto). Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Poland [actually did this](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html) during the Russian invasion in February 2022, because banking access had been obstructed and many people had to flee without the money in their bank accounts. Poland has many Bitcoin ATMs, which allowed those without _any_ banking access in Poland to convert their cryptocurrency to cash.

&nbsp;

## Cryptocurrency

The section on gold above expressed the only application of cryptocurrency I would currently recommend to people who aren't fascinated with the topic and are concerned with growing and protecting their wealth. [This "Intelligent investor" column](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-you-can-get-crypto-investing-right-and-still-play-it-wrong-11643990277) from the WSJ describes the main issue with investing in cryptocurrencies that I'd like to express. Even if _some_ cryptocurrencies appreciate greatly in value, the distribution of returns is almost certain to be highly [positively skewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#/media/File:Relationship_between_mean_and_median_under_different_skewness.png). Unless you're determined to build a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies on your own, there is a high risk of missing out on the appreciation of a small fraction of cryptocurrencies. This is a crucial lesson in stocks as well: the [positively skewed distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek) of returns is why you need to diversify broadly to avoid the risk of underperformance. Someone holding only a few stocks or a few cryptocurrencies bears a high risk of underperforming the asset class return. On top of that, there is no guarantee that cryptocurrency will have a positive asset class return.

## Asset classes in _Reducing the Risk of Black Swans_

Finding imperfectly correlated assets is the heart of [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#clarifying-diversification). A portfolio with imperfectly correlated assets that each have high expected return would be ideal. But how could we achieve equity-like returns that aren't highly correlated with equities? _[Reducing the Risk of Black Swans](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Reducing+the+Risk+of+Black+Swans&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def)_, by Larry Swedroe and Kevin Grogan, seeks to answer this question. You can click the link to download the book. I won't elaborate a great deal because these asset classes are accessible only to high net worth investors or those who are clients of certain wealth management firms. They are also partially illiquid, which is why access is restricted. Regardless of whether you have access, it's a great read because it explores why diversification is important and how to build a very diversified portfolio with high expected return.

## Leveraged funds

In 2006, the SEC [finally permitted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-moves-to-curb-leveraged-etfs-1465205401) the creation of highly leveraged funds, and asset managers like Direxion and ProShares have since created well over 100 leveraged ETFs. Some of them were listed in the midst of the stock market's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. This turned out to be impeccable timing, because the 2010s witnessed a spectacular bull market for US stocks, in particular tech stocks. In addition, interest rates have been low since 2009, minimizing the cost of borrowing money to lever up the returns. One of the most famous leveraged funds is [TQQQ](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/tqqq/). It's named after QQQ, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. The fund uses derivatives to produce three times the daily returns of the Nasdaq 100. If QQQ increases 1% tomorrow, TQQQ will increase by about 3%. If QQQ falls by 2%, TQQQ will fall by about 6%.

From inception in February 2010 through the end of 2021, the average annualized return of TQQQ was [roughly 55%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=TQQQ&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_2=100). An investor who bought shares at the end of Feb 2010 and sold at the end of Dec 2021 would've multiplied their money by about 179. These are eye-watering, brain-shattering, hair-on-fire returns. Who wouldn't want to invest in TQQQ?

We don't have to move into wild hypotheticals to see how a triple-leveraged fund can be hazardous. It's notable that TQQQ was fortunate enough to incept in March 2010, meaning that so far it has never experienced a major, prolonged drawdown for US stocks. However, QQQ was created in March 1999. What if we simply back up the clock and infer the returns of TQQQ from QQQ? What would have happened during the explosion of the tech bubble in the early 2000s?

<p align="center">

</p>

From inception to its lowest point in 2002, QQQ fell by 60.7%. TQQQ would have experienced a decline of about 99.5% in the same period. From its peak, QQQ drew down by 83.0%, while TQQQ would have fallen by about 99.94%. TQQQ investors would have lost virtually everything, and the fund arguably would have closed down due to lack of assets. Had TQQQ been launched alongside QQQ and stayed open, the return since inception of QQQ would be superior to that of TQQQ.

An investor seeking high expected return _could_ allocate a small fraction of their portfolio to a leveraged ETF, and rebalance when its weight deviates significantly from its intended weight. But as I'll explain in the next section, I think options offer a preferable form of leverage. They also permit far more diversification than leveraged ETFs, which tend to be focused on very popular indices like the [S&P 500](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/upro/) and the Nasdaq 100.

&nbsp;

## Options

Before explaining what options are, I think it will be useful to describe why we would consider using them. In the section on risk, we [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#two-broad-types-of-risk) the distinction between compensated and uncompensated risk. And in the section on building a stock portfolio, we [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#moving-beyond-market-cap-weighting) how to systematically invest in riskier stocks in order to increase our expected return. This is a way of taking compensated risk, which is the kind of risk we want. But how could we take even more compensated risk than owning stock funds — which are already quite volatile — with the hope of greater long-term returns? Buying stock is a bet that the stock portfolio will have positive returns, and buying options is a way to make a more extreme bet that those shares will have positive returns. This is a form of [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): a correct prediction can yield much greater gains, and an incorrect one can cause large losses.

So what is an option? It’s a contract between you and another person, who is called the "counterparty" because they’re taking the other side of the trade. The value of the contract is based on the value of an underlying security, like an ETF. There are different types of options, but we’ll focus on only one type, a call option. We’ll make up an ETF that has the ticker “XY”. If we were to buy a call option on XY, the contract would provide us with certain rights. We can buy or sell an option anytime during market hours.

For each call option contract we buy, we acquire the right to buy 100 shares of XY from the counterparty at an agreed-upon price anytime before an agreed-upon expiration date. The option has a cost, called the premium, because we pay the counterparty for these valuable rights. The agreed-upon price is an important aspect of the option, because being able to buy shares at a lower price makes the option more valuable. The agreed-upon price is called the "strike price". The expiration date is another important aspect, because a more distant expiration date gives XY more time to increase in value. At any time, the owner of an option can exercise it and buy 100 shares per contract from the counterparty at the strike price. They can also sell the option to someone else. In this example, XY is the "[underlying](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying.asp)" because the value of the XY options are based on the price of XY.

#### An option’s value

How is the value of an option determined? Like any other security, the market decides on the prevailing price through negotiation between buyers and sellers. But as always, the characteristics of the security act as constraints. An option’s value is divided between intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is simple: if an option’s strike price is below the current market price, the option has intrinsic value. Let’s say the option’s strike price is $150 and the market price is $200. That means we can exercise the option, buy the shares at $150 and sell them at $200. The $50 profit would be multiplied by 100 shares per contract. That’s the nature of intrinsic value.

But even an option whose strike price is greater than the market price has value. We call it extrinsic value, because it reflects the potential for an option to acquire intrinsic value (or gain more than it already has) before expiration. If the strike price were $150 and the market price were $140, there would be no value in exercising the option presently. But it has extrinsic value because the market price may rise above $150 before expiration. An option with a strike price less than the market price is “in the money” (ITM); an option with a strike price greater than the market price is “out of the money” (OTM); and an option with a strike price close to the market price is “at the money” (ATM). Hopefully it makes sense that an in-the-money option has intrinsic value, while an out-of-the-money option does not. However, even OTM options have extrinsic value, as long as they are not about to expire.

&nbsp;

#### Example

Let’s make this more concrete. It’s November 2023, and we own shares of XY, but we’d also like to gain leverage on our expectation that XY’s share price will rise. So we buy call options on XY that expire on January 20, 2025. Let’s say the current share price of XY is $50. For reasons I’ll explain below, we want to buy an ITM option. So we check the price of XY call options expiring on January 20, 2025 with a strike price of $45. The [ask price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) is $7.41, which refers to the price per share. To calculate the price per contract, we multiply by 100 to find that the price of buying a contract is $741.

How much could we profit or lose from this option? Let’s say that by the expiration date, XY’s price has increased by 10% to $55. Our strike price is $45, so we exercise on the expiration date and buy 100 shares for $45. We sell them immediately for $55, making $10 per share and a total of $1,000. Our profit is $259: $1,000 minus the $741 premium. We can compare this to buying shares with the same amount of money: $741 of shares would’ve increased in value by 10% or $74.10.

Note that we’re referring to XY’s _price_ and not its total return. An owner of the underlying receives dividends, whereas an owner of a call option does not. So if XY’s price increased by 10%, an investor in XY shares would’ve gained slightly more. Keep the lack of dividends in mind when considering possible returns of a call option.

Let’s consider the potential downside of an option. Imagine that XY’s share price had fallen 16% to $42 by the expiration date. Because $42 is less than the strike price of $45, the option would expire worthless. The loss would be the value of the contract we purchased: $741. Buying shares with the same $741 would have produced a loss of only $118.56 (minus dividends).

There are more ways to lose money with options than a total loss due to OTM expiration. Imagine that by expiration, XY has appreciated by only 2% to $51. We exercise the option, buying shares at $45 and selling at $51, netting $6 per share and a total of $600. But wait, we _paid_ $741 for this option! So we actually lost $141. Not only that, but if we had bought $741 of shares instead, we would’ve made $14.82 from price appreciation and some more from dividends.

This situation is exactly what the counterparty wants. They’re likely holding 100 shares of XY for every contract they sell you. So they benefit from the price appreciation of XY, the dividends from XY, and from the $741 you paid them for the contract. They sell those 100 shares to you on the expiration date, but the ability to exercise the contract and make $600 is more than compensated by the $741 premium they received over a year prior. It would be very risky for the counterparty to not hold 100 shares per contract they sell, because they would otherwise be exposed to unlimited losses. Selling a call while you hold the underlying is known as selling a “covered call”.
