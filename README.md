# Advanced topics

There are many types of investments beyond the stock and bond portfolios discussed in other sections. These include collectibles like art, coins, and jewelry; real estate; (managed) futures; and hedge funds, which on their own have a universe of possible investments such as private equity and merger arbitrage. Most people can safely ignore derivatives and alternative asset classes. I've addressed only a few below, either because many people are tempted to invest in them for what I think are incorrect reasons, or because I think they're worth considering for experienced and informed investors.

## Gold and other precious metals

There are a few reasons people invest in gold. They may think that it is a widely recognized store of value; that it is a reliable hedge against inflation or economic downturns; or that it will be useful as currency during a potential societal collapse because of its so-called intrinsic value.

Unfortunately, gold is not a good store of value compared to stable currencies like the US dollar. It is a highly volatile asset that can lose value for long periods and has experienced no positive real return over its many centuries of use. Gold is not a reliable hedge against inflation. Its value sometimes increases when unexpected inflation occurs, and sometimes decreases. Crucially, the price does not _respond_ to inflation. For evidence and more information, you could [read](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenDilemma.pdf) [these](https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/GoldenConstant.pdf) [papers](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0015198X.2020.1817698) or watch videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ulgqlQWlPbo), [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_f0dns9fHFs&t=1347s), and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDHJh8CXTVQ&t=927s).

In [this interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSwctXnMnrw&t=4838s) on the Rational Reminder, Dr. Campbell Harvey discussed a fascinating interaction he had with someone who managed a family trust with an investment horizon of hundreds of years. He also mentioned the possibility that gold could lose its value in the very long run due to asteroid mining, which is [not wild speculation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8XvQNt26KI).

I don't recommend investing in precious metals. If you'd like to hedge against unexpectedly high inflation, you can buy [treasury inflation-protected securities](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#f4). If you want good returns during high inflation, you can invest in [Series I savings bonds](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#us-treasury-savings-bonds). If you're not concerned with inflation or diversification, but instead with currency that people will value during an apocalypse, I suggest expanding your portfolio of canned food, medicine, guns, and bullets. I personally find it doubtful that anyone will accept gold coins and bars in exchange for something of real value at the end of the world.

In my view, for most people there is one good reason to own gold: to protect your wealth against a collapse of the value of your home country's currency.  For US citizens, this is not a major concern: USD is the global reserve currency. For someone in a country like Venezuela or Turkey, their wealth is vulnerable to hyperinflation and the loss of their currency's value relative to other currencies. If they have access, they could simply hold other currencies or assets like US-listed securities. If not, they could own gold or a USD stablecoin, the latter of which is the only application of cryptocurrency I would consider suggesting to most people. A USD stablecoin like [USD Coin](https://www.coinbase.com/usdc/) enables someone to own a cryptocurrency that is redeemable for USD, even if they lack access to financial institutions that would allow them to hold USD. A refugee fleeing their country with nothing but their [private key](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/private-key.asp) could convert USD Coin to [fiat currency](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money) once they arrived somewhere with banking institutions (or found someone willing to exchange cash for crypto). Ukrainian refugees fleeing to Poland [actually did this](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/03/23/ukrainian-flees-to-poland-with-2000-in-bitcoin-on-usb-drive.html) during the Russian invasion in February 2022, because banking access had been obstructed and many people had to flee without the money in their bank accounts. Poland has many Bitcoin ATMs, which allowed those without _any_ banking access in Poland to convert their cryptocurrency to cash.

&nbsp;

## Cryptocurrency

The section on gold above expressed the only application of cryptocurrency I would currently recommend to people who aren't fascinated with the topic and are concerned with growing and protecting their wealth. [This "Intelligent investor" column](https://www.wsj.com/articles/bitcoin-you-can-get-crypto-investing-right-and-still-play-it-wrong-11643990277) from the WSJ describes the main issue with investing in cryptocurrencies that I'd like to express. Even if _some_ cryptocurrencies appreciate greatly in value, the distribution of returns is almost certain to be highly [positively skewed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness#/media/File:Relationship_between_mean_and_median_under_different_skewness.png). Unless you're determined to build a diversified portfolio of cryptocurrencies on your own, there is a high risk of missing out on the appreciation of a small fraction of cryptocurrencies. This is a crucial lesson in stocks as well: the [positively skewed distribution](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfdMDGIABek) of returns is why you need to diversify broadly to avoid the risk of underperformance. Someone holding only a few stocks or a few cryptocurrencies bears a high risk of underperforming the asset class return. On top of that, there is no guarantee that cryptocurrency will have a positive asset class return.

&nbsp;

## _Reducing the Risk of Black Swans_

Finding imperfectly correlated assets is the heart of [diversification](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#clarifying-diversification). A portfolio with imperfectly correlated assets that each have high expected return would be ideal. But how could we achieve equity-like returns that aren't highly correlated with equities? _[Reducing the Risk of Black Swans](https://libgen.rs/search.php?req=Reducing+the+Risk+of+Black+Swans&lg_topic=libgen&open=0&view=simple&res=25&phrase=1&column=def)_, by Larry Swedroe and Kevin Grogan, seeks to answer this question. You can click the link to download the book. I won't elaborate a great deal because these asset classes are accessible only to high net worth investors or those who are clients of certain wealth management firms. They are also partially illiquid, which is why access is restricted. Regardless of whether you have access, it's a great read because it explores why diversification is important and how to build a very diversified portfolio with high expected return.

&nbsp;

## Leveraged funds

In 2006, the SEC [finally permitted](https://www.wsj.com/articles/sec-moves-to-curb-leveraged-etfs-1465205401) the creation of highly leveraged funds, and asset managers like Direxion and ProShares have since created well over 100 leveraged ETFs. Some of them were listed in the midst of the stock market's recovery from the 2008 financial crisis. This turned out to be impeccable timing, because the 2010s witnessed a spectacular bull market for US stocks, in particular tech stocks. In addition, interest rates have been low since 2009, minimizing the cost of borrowing money to lever up the returns. One of the most famous leveraged funds is [TQQQ](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/tqqq/). It's named after QQQ, which tracks the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index. The fund uses derivatives to produce three times the daily returns of the Nasdaq 100. If QQQ increases 1% tomorrow, TQQQ will increase by about 3%. If QQQ falls by 2%, TQQQ will fall by about 6%.

From inception in February 2010 through the end of 2021, the average annualized return of TQQQ was [roughly 55%](https://www.portfoliovisualizer.com/backtest-portfolio?s=y&timePeriod=2&startYear=1985&firstMonth=1&endYear=2021&lastMonth=12&calendarAligned=true&includeYTD=false&initialAmount=10000&annualOperation=0&annualAdjustment=0&inflationAdjusted=true&annualPercentage=0.0&frequency=4&rebalanceType=1&absoluteDeviation=5.0&relativeDeviation=25.0&leverageType=0&leverageRatio=0.0&debtAmount=0&debtInterest=0.0&maintenanceMargin=25.0&leveragedBenchmark=false&reinvestDividends=true&showYield=false&showFactors=false&factorModel=3&portfolioNames=false&portfolioName1=Portfolio+1&portfolioName2=Portfolio+2&portfolioName3=Portfolio+3&symbol1=TQQQ&allocation1_1=100&symbol2=QQQ&allocation2_2=100). An investor who bought shares at the end of Feb 2010 and sold at the end of Dec 2021 would've multiplied their money by about 179. These are eye-watering, brain-shattering, hair-on-fire returns. Who wouldn't want to invest in TQQQ?

We don't have to move into wild hypotheticals to see how a triple-leveraged fund can be hazardous. It's notable that TQQQ was fortunate enough to incept in March 2010, meaning that so far it has never experienced a major, prolonged drawdown for US stocks. (TQQQ fell by 69.9% during the COVID crash, but the market quickly recovered.) However, QQQ was created in March 1999. What if we simply back up the clock and infer the returns of TQQQ from QQQ? What would have happened during the explosion of the tech bubble in the early 2000s?

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/investindex/Advanced/blob/main/TQQQ.png" width="631" height="540"/>
</p>

From inception to its lowest point in 2002, QQQ fell by 60.7%. TQQQ would have experienced a decline of about 99.5% in the same period. From its peak, QQQ drew down by 83.0%, while TQQQ would have fallen by about 99.94%. TQQQ investors would have lost virtually everything, and the fund arguably would have closed down due to lack of assets. Had TQQQ been launched alongside QQQ and stayed open, the return since inception of QQQ would be superior to that of TQQQ.

An investor seeking high expected return _could_ allocate a __small fraction__ of their portfolio to a leveraged ETF, and rebalance when its weight deviates significantly from its intended weight. But as I'll explain in the next section, I think options offer a preferable form of leverage.

&nbsp;

## Options

Options are a [derivative](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/derivative.asp), which means they derive their value from the price of an underlying security, like a stock or an ETF. They are complex — much harder to understand than a stock or bond fund. So I don't expect a reader to feel like they have a complete understanding of how to invest in options after reading the section below. Before or after reading the written information, it will help to watch videos. These [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PM4rNDr4oI) [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJjRnKpwDyw) are detailed tutorials on how options work. Combining these with the written suggestions below will help with digesting this dense material. The YouTube channel [InTheMoney](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfMiRVQJuTj3NpZZP1tKShQ/videos) is a good resource on options in general, and his outro music is hypnotic. Understanding options is not easy and will require multiple hours of effort to reach a point at which you can think about how to include them in your portfolio.

&nbsp;

### Introduction to options

Before explaining what options are, I think it will be useful to describe why we would consider using them. In the section on risk, we [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Risk#two-broad-types-of-risk) the distinction between compensated and uncompensated risk. And in the section on building a stock portfolio, we [discussed](https://github.com/investindex/Portfolio#moving-beyond-market-cap-weighting) how to systematically invest in riskier stocks in order to increase our expected return. This is a way of taking compensated risk, which is the kind of risk we want. But how could we take even more compensated risk than owning stock funds — which are already quite volatile — with the hope of greater long-term returns? Buying stock is a bet that the stock portfolio will have positive returns, and buying options is a way to make a more extreme bet that those shares will have positive returns. This is a form of [leverage](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/leverage.asp): a correct prediction can yield much greater gains, and an incorrect one can cause large losses.

So what is an option? It’s a contract between you and another person, who is called the "counterparty" because they’re taking the other side of the trade. The value of the contract is based partly on the value of an underlying security, like an ETF. There are different types of options, but we’ll focus on only one type, a call option. We’ll make up an ETF with the ticker “XY”. If we buy a call option on XY, the contract would provide us with certain rights.

For each call option contract we buy, we acquire the right to buy 100 shares of XY from the counterparty at an agreed-upon price anytime before an agreed-upon expiration date. The option has a cost, called the premium, because we pay the counterparty for these valuable rights. The agreed-upon price at which we can buy XY is an important aspect of the option, because being able to buy shares at a lower price makes the option more valuable. The agreed-upon price is called the "strike price". The expiration date is another important aspect, because a more distant expiration date gives XY more time to increase in value. At any time, the owner of an option can exercise it and buy 100 shares per contract from the counterparty at the strike price. They can also sell the option to someone else. In this example, XY is the "[underlying](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underlying.asp)" because the value of the XY options are based on the price of XY. An option always controls exactly 100 shares of the underlying. We can buy or sell an option anytime during market hours.

&nbsp;

### An option’s value

How is the value of an option determined? Like any other security, the market decides on the prevailing price through negotiation between buyers and sellers. But as always, the characteristics of the security act as constraints. An option’s value is divided between intrinsic and extrinsic value. Intrinsic value is simple: if an option’s strike price is below the current market price, the option has intrinsic value. Let’s say the option’s strike price is $150 and the market price is $200. That means we can exercise the option, buy the shares at $150 and sell them at $200. The $50 profit would be multiplied by 100 shares per contract. That’s the nature of intrinsic value.

But even an option whose strike price is greater than the market price has value. We call it extrinsic value, because it reflects the potential for an option to acquire intrinsic value (or gain more than it already has) before expiration. If the strike price were $150 and the market price were $140, there would be no value in exercising the option presently. But it has extrinsic value because the market price may rise above $150 before expiration. An option with a strike price less than the market price is “in the money” (ITM); an option with a strike price greater than the market price is “out of the money” (OTM); and an option with a strike price close to the market price is “at the money” (ATM). As silly as it sounds, this variable is called "moneyness". Hopefully it makes sense that an in-the-money option has intrinsic value, while an out-of-the-money option does not. The value of OTM options is entirely composed of extrinsic value (also known as time value).

&nbsp;

### Example

Let’s make this more concrete. It’s November 2023, and we own shares of XY, but we’d also like to gain leverage on our expectation that XY’s share price will rise. So we buy call options on XY that expire on January 20, 2025. Let’s say the current share price of XY is $50. For reasons I’ll explain below, we want to buy an in-the-money (ITM) option. So we check the price of XY call options expiring on January 20, 2025 with a strike price of $45. The [ask price](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bid-askspread.asp) is $7.41, which refers to the price per share. To calculate the price per contract, we multiply by 100 to find that the price of buying a contract is $741.

How much could we profit or lose from this option? Let’s say that by the expiration date, XY’s price has increased by 10% to $55. Our strike price is $45, so we exercise on the expiration date and buy 100 shares for $45. We sell them immediately for $55, making $10 per share and a total of $1,000. Our profit is $259: $1,000 minus the $741 premium. We can compare this to buying shares with the same amount of money: $741 of shares would’ve increased in value by 10% or $74.10.

Note that we’re referring to XY’s _price_ and not its total return. An owner of the underlying receives dividends, whereas an owner of a call option does not. So if XY’s price increased by 10%, an investor in XY shares would’ve gained slightly more. Keep the lack of dividends in mind when considering possible returns of a call option.

Let’s consider the potential downside of an option. Imagine that XY’s share price has fallen 16% to $42 by the expiration date. Because $42 is less than the strike price of $45, the option expires worthless. The loss would be the value of the contract we purchased: $741. Buying shares with the same $741 would have produced a loss of only $118.56 (minus dividends).

There are more ways to lose money with options than a total loss due to OTM expiration. Imagine that by expiration, XY has appreciated by only 2% to $51. We exercise the option, buying shares at $45 and selling at $51, netting $6 per share and a total of $600. But wait, we _paid_ $741 for this option! So we actually lost $141. Not only that, but if we had bought $741 of shares instead, we would’ve made $14.82 from price appreciation and some more from dividends. The $141 + $14.82 + dividends is an [opportunity cost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost): we could've profited by purchasing shares instead of an option.

The last situation is good for the counterparty. They’re likely holding 100 shares of XY for every contract they sell you. So they benefit from the price appreciation of XY, the dividends from XY, and from the $741 you paid them for the contract. They sell those 100 shares to you on the expiration date, but your ability to exercise the contract and make $600 is more than compensated by the $741 premium they received over a year prior. It would be very risky for the counterparty to not hold 100 shares per contract they sell, because they would otherwise be exposed to unlimited losses. Selling a call while you hold the underlying is known as selling a “covered call”.

&nbsp;

### Calculating the breakeven price

An important price you should be able to calculate before buying an option is the breakeven price. This is the price the underlying needs to reach by expiration for you to break even. In this case, our gains from an increase in the price of XY need to counterbalance the $741 premium. We paid $7.41 per share for the option with a strike price of $45 when XY's price was $50 per share. In order to break even, the price would need to rise to $45 + $7.41 = $52.41, which is a 4.82% increase from $50. Of course, if the option expires at the breakeven price or slightly above, we would've profited more by investing in shares instead, so this doesn't account for the opportunity cost.

The breakeven price is important not just for understanding a given option contract, but for comparing different option contracts. If we buy an ITM option with a strike price of $45 while the market price is $50, that option is 10% ITM: (50-45)/50 = .1 = 10%. If we were to buy a 20% ITM option with a strike price of $40, the breakeven price would be significantly lower. The option would also face a much lower risk of expiring worthless. However, the premium would be more expensive. In contrast, an at-the-money (ATM) option with a strike price of $50 would have a higher breakeven price than the option we chose. An OTM option with a strike price of $52 would be cheaper, but it would have a breakeven price that is higher still. So anyone who buys an OTM contract is betting on high returns for the underlying. Options that are deeper in the money are less risky and have higher premiums; options that are further out of the money are riskier and have lower premiums.

For most investors who want to lever up by buying call options, I think it's sensible to buy long-term options with breakeven prices that anticipate modest returns, like the 10% ITM option with a breakeven increase of 4.82% and expiration in 14 months. Buying OTM options is risky and can easily lead to major losses, including total loss.

&nbsp;

### Risk management

Risk management with this approach to options is relatively simple. The first aspect is appropriate position sizing. Even for someone with a high risk tolerance and a 30-year time horizon, I don't recommend occupying more than 10-15% of your portfolio with options. In a portfolio with 90% stock funds and 10% ETF call options, the options will generate at least as much volatility as the stock funds despite being a much smaller portion. Exceeding 20% of your portfolio would be very risky, unless you're buying deep ITM options.

In addition to position sizing, rebalancing is crucial. If the underlying securities perform very well in a given year, your options could expand from an initial 10% to 20% or more of the portfolio. This expansion could keep occurring for years in a long bull market, but you should not allow it. There is no way to reliably predict when it will happen, but eventually the underlying ETFs will experience a deep, prolonged drawdown. Their prices will fall below the strike price of your options, and the options will expire worthless.

### Which ETFs?

Many ETFs have option markets (mutual funds do not). Ideally, I could invest in my [favorite portfolio of ETFs](https://github.com/investindex/Fund/blob/main/README.md#example-portfolio) and buy call options on the same ETFs. But options are not like ETFs, where bid-ask spreads are negligible for long-term investors. Bid-ask spreads on an ETF that isn't especially popular might be 0.1% or 0.2%, but this isn't important because it's still a small spread and you can hold for a very long time. Liquidity becomes a very important consideration for options because you can't hold for an indefinite duration, and spreads on ETFs with very little options activity can be abysmal. It is not hard to find an ETF that has some options with 50% bid-ask spreads. Spreads on a given security's options tend to be larger for options with more distant expiration dates and strike prices that are further from the market price (deep ITM or OTM), because those options are traded less frequently.

So we can't simply pick our favorite ETFs. [AVUV](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-u-s-small-cap-value-etf.html) has a thinly traded option market with wide spreads, and [AVES](https://www.avantisinvestors.com/content/avantis/en/investments/avantis-emerging-markets-value-etf.html) is so new that there is no option trading. We have to narrow our focus to ETFs with large AUM and high trading volume, which tend to be provided by large asset managers like Vanguard, BlackRock, State Street, and Invesco. Not only do ETFs with more active option markets have smaller spreads, they also have a larger number of available expiration dates.

Let's start with exposure to cap-weighted equity. The most liquid option market in the world is [SPY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy), an S&P 500 ETF managed by State Street. This is a good enough representation of cap-weighted US equity to use for call options. The main drawback is not that SPY includes only 500 stocks, but that SPY has a share price over $400. Long-term call options on an ETF with such a high share price are several thousand dollars for a single contract, which is an obstacle for small investors. [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti), Vanguard's total US stock ETF, has a lower share price and a very liquid option market. For developed markets outside the US, [EFA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239623/ishares-msci-eafe-etf) has by far the most liquid options. It does not include Canada, but Canada occupies only 3% of global market capitalization, so this is not significant.

For emerging markets, [EEM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239637/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-etf) has the most actively traded options. However, it has an expense ratio of 0.68%, so [VWO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwo), Vanguard's ETF with an expense ratio of 0.08%, may be a good substitute. EEM has a larger number of expiration dates, but if there is a VWO option with an expiration date suitable for your portfolio, is it probably a better fund. VWO does not include South Korea and EEM does, so an options portfolio with EFA and VWO for international exposure will omit South Korea. For a much lower expense ratio, this is arguably an acceptable drawback. [IWN](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239712/ishares-russell-2000-value-etf) has the most liquid options for US small cap value.

So we can build a globally diversified portfolio with [SPY](https://www.ssga.com/us/en/individual/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-500-etf-trust-spy) or [VTI](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vti) for US equity, [EFA](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239623/ishares-msci-eafe-etf) for developed ex-North America equity, [EEM](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239637/ishares-msci-emerging-markets-etf) or [VWO](https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/etfs/profile/vwo) for emerging markets equity, and [IWN](https://www.ishares.com/us/products/239712/ishares-russell-2000-value-etf) for US small cap value stocks.

&nbsp;

### Practical information

The explanation above described options as if the goal were to exercise them. An option is indeed valuable because of the owner's right to exercise it, but most people who buy an option don't exercise it — they sell it. Practically, you probably will not have enough money in your account to exercise a call option without selling your other assets. In the example above with XY, we bought a call option with a strike price of $45, which means that buying 100 shares would require $4,500. Rather than coming up with that much money, it usually makes more sense to simply sell the option before expiration (in that case, before market close on Jan 20 2025).

Like applying for margin, you have to apply for option trading. Brokers distinguish between different types of option trades, based on how potentially risky the types of trades are. "Long calls" are a relatively low-risk strategy. Fidelity separates option trading into Levels 1 through 5, and to run this strategy you need Level 2. Schwab has Levels 0 through 3, and to run this strategy you need Level 1.

### ETF call options or leveraged ETFs?

We discussed above how we could build a portfolio of ETF call options, perhaps VTI + EFA + VWO + IWN. Could we build a similar portfolio with leveraged ETFs? We could achieve 2x daily exposure to the S&P 500 ([SSO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/sso/)/[SPUU](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-sp-500-bull-2x-etf)), developed ex-North America markets ([EFO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/efo/)), and emerging markets ([EET](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/eet/)). We could also achieve 3x daily exposure to the S&P 500 ([UPRO](https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/upro/)/[SPXL](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-sp-500-bull-bear-3x-etfs)) and emerging markets ([EDC](https://www.direxion.com/product/daily-msci-emerging-markets-bull-bear-3x-etfs)), but not developed ex-US markets.

There are no leveraged ETFs with small cap value exposure. Since small cap value adds a great deal of diversification to a cap-weighted portfolio, this is a significant drawback. But let's focus on the question only for cap-weighted equities: are call options or leveraged ETFs a better way to increase compensated risk?

The returns of a leveraged ETF are path-dependent, while the intrinsic value of an option is not.
